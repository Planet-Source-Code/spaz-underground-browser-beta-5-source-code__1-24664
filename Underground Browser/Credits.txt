This is a whole New Look for the 
Browser, Changed the Menus and
the tool bar this allows for
more flexability in the program
and better performance.

____________________________________

Finally Got the Menus in the
right place, displaying the 
correct icon, still want it to fall
bellow the Top menu but. it does not
want to. Got the indexes working 
correct after reading the Documentation
for the cNewMenu ;), which I overlooked
File association is excelent could ask 
for more it handles it great.
--------------------------------------
Best of all the Popup Killa is working at
99.9% gave me a few bugs but the new way of 
killing popups is excelent, not much resources 
are used and it does it in record time without
the user knowing it was running.
